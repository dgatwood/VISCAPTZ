IMPORTANT: There are multiple versions of the Rock Pi E hardware, and the
pinouts are VERY different.  Later versions use the v1.2 header.  This is
based on that hardware.  If you have an older board, this may be different.

Because it is critical that the motors not be powered during the boot process,
this is an attempt to map out the GPIO pins to determine which ones meet that
criterion.  Unfortunately Radxa provides zero documentation, so this is all by
trial and error.

Step 1: Check each pin while booted to determine which are *definitely* not usable.
Step 2: Power each pin one at a time to make sure the light comes on, then turn
        it off, reboot and make sure it stays off.
