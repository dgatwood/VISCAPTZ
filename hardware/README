These are plates for attaching BRT38-COM4069D24-RT1 rotary encoders or similar to a
Vidpro MH-430 motorized pan and tilt gimbal.

The alternate plate 3 is an earlier version of plate 3 that can be used for the
tilt axis to make it visually obvious which encoder goes on which axis.  (The
two encoders are not interchangeable unless you modify the code to use two
separate CAN buses.)

Note: The alternate plate 3 cannot be used for the pan encoder, because it bumps
into the vertical post that holds up the gimbal.
