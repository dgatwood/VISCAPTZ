These are plates for attaching BRT38-COM4069D24-RT1 rotary encoders or similar to a
Vidpro MH-430 motorized pan and tilt gimbal.

Note: The two STL files are generated from the same OpenSCAD file.  The only
difference is which text string ("PAN" or "TILT") was uncommented at the time
of export.

Screws:

* The screws holding the two plastic parts together are M3 16mm screws with M3
  nuts.  (If I had 14mm, that would be better, but 12mm is too short.)
* The screws holding the spring are M3 12mm screws.  One post has M3 and M4
  washers to give a better grip on the spring.  The other side hooks over
  after assembly.
* The spring is 5/16" x 1 1/8".  (Initially, I tried a 11/32" x 1 7/16" spring,
  but it didn't quite provide enough tension.)
* The threaded thumb screw on the clamp is M6, to match the thread of the
  original wing screws (so that you don't have to remember which tap to use).
  You will need two extra washers on the original screw and four washers
  on the new screw, because the hole isn't deep enough for plastic strength
  reasons.
* The motor screws are M3 12mm.  The original motor screws are too short
  without making the plastic unacceptably thin.  (I actually had one of the
  heads pull through with the previous design.  Even now, do not overtorque 
  any of the screws!)
